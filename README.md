# spss.nvim

## Description

This was a fork from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). See the original README there.

After digesting and understanding lua and neovim configurations better (thanks to kickstart), I started to modify the original kickstart.nvim configuration to my own liking, adding few plugins and modifying the configuration to my own taste. The more I added and the more I found myself looking at other configurations, the more I realized how unbelievable [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) is. It's a configuration that is so well thought out and so well documented that I decided to abandon this and use that as a base for my own configuration instead. I will keep this repository for reference and for anyone who wants to use it as a starting point for their own configuration.
